<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a strategy and marketing professional living in Milwaukee, WI. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I’ve worked with developers in the past and I am interested in working more effectively with them in the future. I also have some ideas for side projects that would be easier to pursue if I knew more about front-end web design and development.</p>
